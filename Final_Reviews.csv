One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).<br/><br/>2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel's apartment is spotless.

Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. <br/><br/>The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. <br/><br/>The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  <br/><br/>To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there.

Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. <br/><br/><br/>After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.<br/><br/>When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. <br/><br/>Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. <br/><br/>We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. <br/>He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. <br/><br/>You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! <br/>For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.<br/><br/>After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.<br/>There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. <br/>The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. <br/>WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for (Hidden by Airbnb) , but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. <br/><br/>After this he showed us the bathroom.

We walked out the door, turned right, and just a block away were plenty of restaurants, bars, and shopping. The apartment is practically around the corner from Rembrandt Square! <br/>The only thing that put a damper on the trip was when I communicated that our train had been delayed and would get in at 7:30 instead of 4:30, still within the original 2-10pm check-in guidelines. Alex's immediate response was that we were pretty much SOL because he would not be home and there was no way for us to get the keys to our room. Eventually he was able to get a friend to wait for our arrival in order to let us in, show us our room and explain all the rules. However, he charged us extra money for the inconvenience.  It took a lot of back-and-forth texting to get to that point. I was stressing out.  I think that it would be nice if he had a contingency plan in case of delays that are out of the guests' control.<br/>Once we got settled everything was fine. The room is more spacious than I expected, the bed is comfortable, and we were glad to have a TV. The bathroom is a little small but has good water pressure.  It was like a hotel room with no access to other areas of the house, and that was fine with us. I would recommend staying there and being careful to make sure your arrival time is accurate. You might want to give yourself a little cushion to account for arriving, not just the time your flight or train gets in, because he won't wait around for long and might try to charge you for making a change.  But again, the location is just perfect for walking out the front door and getting to explore the center of the city by walking or biking.

Very convenient for exploring other areas of the city.  The building itself is quite old. You'll need to climb two flights of stairs to get to the room, which is a little dark. I would suggest putting brighter lights, as it makes for easier packing and unpacking. The wifi signal was weak and spotty at times, so it's not great if you are heavily reliant on wifi. The building is made of wood and quite old, so sometimes you can hear feel vibrations when neighbours slam their doors (so make sure you don't slam yours). Unfortunately, that's just part of staying in an old wooden apartment. The bathroom is a bit tight, and you will be instructed to leave the little window open, as there are no ventilators installed. As there's no heater in the bathroom, the bathroom will be very cold, if the weather is cold. Get ready to sit on a cold toilet seat, which also happens to be unusually high. Fortunately the shower doors help to keep the heat in while showering. If you stay here, watch out for the knobs that stick out of the bed rails. We jammed our hips into it several times, as the space between the bed and the wall and windows is quite narrow, and the room is dark. Also, there is no hot water boiler/electric kettle in the room (due to an incident with a previous guest, we were told), so you won't be able to make coffee or tea. Fortunately there are some really nice cafes and bakeries (go to <br/> C'est Magnifique at Leidsestraat 18) below and nearby.

The arrival process was very smooth as flip communicated with me via email to ensure everything was ready by he time I wanted to check in.  There was water and 2 local brews awaiting upon our arrival and the place was very clean.  We had 2 bikes with locks and a canoe to use at our disposal. The house boat is located very close to everything you will want to see in Amsterdam but is on a quiet canal which was relaxing.  There is a nice patio outside that we were able to drink wine on and watch boats go by on the canal.  The breakfast provided was delicious, fresh bread and croissants, cheese and sausage, eggs, jams and honey, cereal granola milk and yogurt.. More than enough for 2 people.

If you are looking at any other apartment or house boat in Amsterdam just STOP and book this one now! <br/>The boat's location is outside of the city center which is great for peace & quiet.
